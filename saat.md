# INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY:
**Cybersecurity** is to secure data of people digitally. To secure itself data is not a cybersecurity actually it secure data of team, network, organization and company. It is also the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. 
# OBJECTIVES OF CYBERSECURITY:
To secure a data of company through road map that how they work, how their network didn't break and how to protect their data from unauthorized access. For this thee are three main principles:
  - Confidentiality
  - Integrity
  - Availability
# ROLES IN CYBERSECURITY:
  - To maintain a security of application
  - To protect data from being loss, read and avoid to going (one person that making a backup of data)
  - Forensics (activities that performed in computer, actual meaning how to work, searching)
  - Incident response (responsible team we call it front office staff or monitoring team.. if any negative activity is performed on runtime then this team informed their head that this activity is done by this person and then this team take action on the spot)
  - Vulnerability management (to hit weakness of any website, server, computer or any person. signing of MOC that is in the form of terms and conditions etc. )
  - Network security.
  - Security architecture.
  - Threat intelligence. 
# SOME COMMON METHODS THAT THREATEN CYBER-SECURITY:
- **Malware**:

      Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user’s computer.
- **SQL injection**:

      An SQL (structured language query) injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in data-driven applications to insert malicious code into a databased via a malicious SQL statement. 
- **Phishing**:

      Phishing is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.
- **Man-in-the-middle attack**:

      A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a cybercriminal intercepts communication between two individuals in order to steal data. For example, on an unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could intercept data being passed from the victim’s device and the network.
- **Denial-of-service attack**:

      A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.
